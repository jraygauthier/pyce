"""
This defines the Soroco import machinery to import .pyce formatted Python
files.  Such files are defined as an AES-256 convergently encrypted Python
files with a SHA-512 HMAC.

You can enable the Python format for your interpreter by doing the following:

>>> from pyce import add_import_hook
>>> add_import_hook()

If you had encrypted Python code, you would want to then pass the keys for
encryption/decryption to the add_import_hook call, with the appropriate
format.
